## JavaScript!
Recently I have begun exploring JavaScript as part of a Software Engineering course I am taking. I was struck immediately by how much could be taken for granted, from data types to memory allocation. Insofar every programming language I have worked with had stricter declarations, sometimes to the point of being stereotyped with comically excessive verbosity (// looking at you, Java sans the ‘Script’). It turns out that the alternative seems to be a lawless, Wild-West-esque land of *const*antly *let*ting *var*iables traverse trails of self-discovery on their own. Consequently, I have a newfound appreciation for the grounding clarity brought by the strictness of JavaScript’s more descriptive elder. 
So far, I tend to mentally assign strict data types to variables I create anyway, and that works for now. I hope to adapt to the looser restrictions of JavaScript as I continue using the language as that seems to be one of its strengths once one gets accustomed, and I would like to be able to take advantage of it. 
## ES6 Experiences
Part of my exploration of JavaScript involved exercises demonstrating new features from ES6, one of the earlier revisions of JavaScript as a whole. It was… interesting. While I am sure there are quite a few use cases for features like arrow functions and the … operator, I just cannot imagine them from where I am, unfamiliar with the language both before and after this update and having not experienced the inconveniences which led to their official implementation. Throughout the course motivating my dive into JavaScript, I expect to experience those inconveniences in excruciating detail, only to recall midway through my attempt at a solution that it was already built into the language almost a decade prior. 
## CrossFit?
The Software Engineering course I am taking places a strong emphasis on ‘Athletic Software Engineering’, wherein students complete challenging, time-limited programming exercises called ‘Workouts of the Day’, a term borrowed from CrossFit (// neat, huh?). The analogy here is as clear as it is ironic, seeing as our workouts mostly consist of thinking hard while sitting in front of a laptop typing – and maybe perplexedly scratching one’s head – but the benefits are analogous as well according to the many testimonials from past students that my professor shared. Also, according to me since I have already felt myself improve as a programmer in the crucible that is a Workout of the Day. We have only completed a few workouts so far, but I can already tell that I will continue to get better at software engineering whether I like it or not, which seems to be the intended effect. I welcome the challenge – it seems like it will continue to be fun and engaging.
