Although I have written and thought a bunch about Software Engineering as a concept, my experience actually working with a team to design and build a complete product was nil until my work on ProfTCG.

ProfTCG is a project I completed for ICS 314 Software Engineering, a course focused on software engineering principles using web application development as a medium. 
My team and I came up with the idea while brainstorming fun applications to make for our final project, which needed to involve concepts like databases and UI.
In short, ProfTCG is a professor trading card game website which has card opening, collecting, and trading functionality - you can read more about it and what I worked on [here](you can read more about it [here](proftcg.md)).
