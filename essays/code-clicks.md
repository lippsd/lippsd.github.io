I love it when something *clicks* into place.

Most would assume that I am referring to something like the feedback from a well-crafted button or switch, or perhaps slotting in the final piece of a large puzzle. And yes, that is true - those *are* pretty satisfying - but what I refer to goes beyond that.

In much the same way that a button or puzzle piece can click, so too can ideas. That magical moment when what was once a thick, hazy mist, a mysterious miasma of confusion, gives way to certain clarity. *Click!* Like a camera, after much fiddling, finally coming into focus. The satisfaction from a new idea clicking into place is hard to describe, but those who love to learn will know what I mean. 

So, too, does code click into place. Each block of code slotting together like a childhood bucket of mismatched Legos, combining into a structure far greater than the sum of its parts. The different styles of each programmer like the random colors of each piece, held together by a standard of modular shapes - their creativity on full display. 

The puzzle that is some greater problem, being solved slowly, incrementally, with each new piece clicking into its proper place. Each new piece reframing those from before, resonating more and more harmoniously, more wholly. Until suddenly, the puzzle is complete - and as you back away from the final corner piece, a vista comes into view, letting you know that your work here is done.

Of course, code does not actually always come together so well. But that just means I get to keep clicking!
