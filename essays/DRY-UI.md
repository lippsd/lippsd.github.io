Recently I have been working on using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 to recreate a variety of websites.

## What are HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5?
HTML and CSS are the foundation on which much of the internet lies, being the markup and stylesheet languages which give webpages their text and image formatting. On the other hand, Bootstrap 5 is a popular UI framework which includes templates for much of what one might wish to do on a webpage they are creating - think things like buttons, forms, and page navigation.

Bootstrap and other UI frameworks are quite complex in and of themselves, so why would one want to tackle the challenge of learning to use one alongside the absolutely crucial HTML and CSS languages?

## Why UI Frameworks Work
One of the most often repeated programming mantras is - ironically - DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. It’s very catchy, though the point may be better communicated through ‘don’t reinvent the wheel (unless you just want to learn by doing so)’. We as programmers rely on the work of others to ration time for building what we actually want. For example, most programmers do not create and use their own compiler, instead opting for the perfectly good compilers that have already been quite optimized - albeit occasionally overriding it for code that requires very high performance. 

Bootstrap, then, serves as a well-designed, thoughtfully-crafted wheel that front-end web developers can use to build the websites they want to see in the world (wide web). Well, it may be more appropriate to compare it to a literal bootstrap. Those things haven't seen innovation in centuries because there's so little room for notable improvement, especially by amateur... cobblers? In keeping with the analogy to amateur programmers like myself. But I digress.

## Lifetime
It would absolutely be possible to recreate the features Bootstrap provides - and it might even be better suited to some of the particular purposes of the recreator. Trying to implement the lifetime of iterative improvements and mass of efficacy testing from its many users into a new end product from scratch, though, would require a lifetime and a half to complete. It is far more efficient to simply understand the ins and outs (Literally. The inputs and outputs, not the innerworkings which that phrase somehow implies) of what *was* built and use it to build the bigger and better things of the future - albeit while occasionally overriding it using HTML and CSS when highly specific formatting is warranted. 

Basically, we should endeavor to program and design as lazily as possible. With the necessary quality, functionality, and so on as well, of course. Save yourself some time and use the bigger building blocks available to you wherever possible.
