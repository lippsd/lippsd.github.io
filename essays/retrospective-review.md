TeamUSA2025 was a team I worked with for ICS 414 Software Engineering II, where we developed a web app version of an accounting Excel spreadsheet according to the specifications of a real world company.
This project was very difficult to work on, involving a large development team of eight people, an unfamiliar tech stack, and exclusive focus on self-directed work (i.e. no typical learning content).

### Opportunity
A key feature of this project is the involvement of feedback from a real world company. This served as a unique opportunity for my team to actualize the real desires of a profitable business. As part of this, we had regular meetings where we presented what we'd been working on and received feedback. It was a unique challenge making changes in their interest and conveying that thoughtfully in order to show our work in the best light. 

### Code Reviews
A key difference between the process for this project and my ICS 314 project (discussed [here](looking-back-and-moving-forward.md)

### Challenges
