### Overview
ProfTCG is a professor trading card web application which allows users to collect and trade cards based on UH Manoa's ICS professors.
This project is intended to help with the problem of disconnect between students and professors. Specifically, the difficulty of networking and socializing with professors: learning their areas of research interest, getting to know them as a person, and more.

By providing students with an engaging opportunity to read fun facts about their professors - including past/current research and bits of trivia - as well as by starting conversations about these topics among students through the trading feature, we worked to alleviate this issue in a fun and interesting way.

As this was a team project, I did not work on every section. My areas of interest were account management, the process of adding new cards to our collection, and our User Guide.

### Account Management
I edited our account system to use usernames rather than e-mail to make the user experience feel less clinical, and make UI/UX changes to the sign up-in-out pages for increased legibility and appearance - these changes include panel coloring and the removal of link underlines. Under the suggestion of a team member, the sign-out page has a .gif of a friendly character.

### Add Cards
This was the area I did the most true software development. My task was to create a 

### User Guide
I wrote up the entire User Guide and did all the screenshots. Documentation and guide-writing is somewhat underappreciated, but it helped me get an understanding of the narrative of a user as they move through our application. Doing so taught be a bit about

### Takeaways
This was the first true software development project I have ever worked on. I learned a lot about project management, coding standards, functional programming, and some of their applications to other parts of my life which I discuss [here](looking-back-and-moving-forward.md).

More practically, I learned about using GitHub to manage
