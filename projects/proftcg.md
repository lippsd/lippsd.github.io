### Overview
ProfTCG is a professor trading card web application which allows users to collect and trade cards based on UH Manoa's ICS professors.
This project is intended to help with the problem of disconnect between students and professors. Specifically, the difficulty of networking and socializing with professors: learning their areas of research interest, getting to know them as a person, and more.

By providing students with an engaging opportunity to read fun facts about their professors - including past/current research and bits of trivia - as well as by starting conversations about these topics among students through the trading feature, we worked to alleviate this issue in a fun and interesting way.

## My Contributions
As this was a team project, I did not work on every section. My areas of interest were account management and the process of adding new cards to our collection.
