In high school, I designed a community service project called Mental Health Meetups, wherein students would join a peer group that talks about mental health. 

There would've been anonymous means of communication to make participants feel more comfortable sharing, moderation to prevent overly judgmental responses, possibly even guest speakers. I researched fairly in-depth into teenage mental health, learning about the obstacles preventing my peers from being more open and honest with each other about how they feel. I contacted organizations in my community like NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) - Hawaii, did interviews with faculty in the school, and I had gotten one of the school counselors to be my mentor for the project. 

Sadly, not enough time was left to gather sufficient participants after all the planning and permissions were finished. Toward the end, there was also a recommendation from a trusted advisor which would require significant changes to the project's implementation, and so with a lack of time and a need to replan, the project was discontinued - its likely that forcing it into implementation would not have gone well, given the subject matter.

This was one of the first major disappointments of my academic career. I put a lot of work and care into the project, and to see it all go to waste was disheartening. 

I learned a lot in the process, though. In the immediate aftermath, I learned how to let go of a dead project. Throughout the project, I got hands-on experience with professionalism, building redundant crisis management systems, using research to prove the efficacy of certain strategies, and planning within both the highly specific and bigger picture frames of reference. 

I practiced writing with quality in quantity, adjusting the style and form of a presentation with the audience in mind, and worked on everything - from the logo to the planned topics for each meeting - all the way up until the project's closure. As much as it hurt to let this project go, these skills remain.
